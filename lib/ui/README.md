# UI for Input/Output

UI stands for "User Interface". 

This layer's business is to accept input from users and display ouput to them regardless of the concrete method. 

Some users may want to use the system as a mobile app installed to their Android/iOS. Other may want to use the system via their terminal. Web API, voice, or other interfaces are also possible.

# Interchangeable

UI is interchangeable. Users can choose with what interface they interact with the system without changing businesslogic.

Regardless of the interfaces, users can ask synonyms of "get" to the system, for instance, and can see the system replying "request", "fetch", "retrieve", etc would be possible as its answer.

# Independent from Repository
